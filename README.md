# Colley-Thurston Matrix Rankings (ctmatrix)

Repo for the MATLAB code behind the Colley-Thurston Matrix algorithm used to rank sports teams based on strength of schedule and margin of victory.
## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
* Software capable of running MATLAB scripts
** MATLAB, or
** [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)
```

### Installing

After your MATLAB software is installed, make sure the ctmatrix.m file is in the current path, by either changing the path to include the directory the file is in, or by moving the file to a directory in the current path.


## Built With

* [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) - The MATLAB software used
* [Massey Ratings](http://masseyratings.com/data.php) - Data source of sports scores in a MATLAB-friendly format

## Contributing

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426) for details on our code of conduct, and the process for submitting pull requests to us.

## Versioning

We use our own custom versioning system. Versions are in the X.Y.Z format.  

X increments for major changes, defined as fundamentally changing the algorithm used to rank sports teams.

Y increments for minor changes, defined as adding or removing functionalities, like leagues the code is compatible with.

Z increments for other changes, like cleaning up the code, fixing errors or bugs, etc.

For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/chem031/ctmatrix/tags).
